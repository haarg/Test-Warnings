          - Test suite (and code) fixed to work in the presence of
            Test::Builder 1.005+ (TB2)
          - END logic fixed: now a no-warnings test is added whenever any
            tests have been run, even if there is no plan, as was originally
            intended

          Releasing as non-TRIAL for greater visibility.
          - ':no_end_test' option added
          - test added showing that we play nicely with 'skip_all'
