=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;
    use Test::Warnings;

    pass('yay!');
    done_testing;

emits TAP:

    ok 1 - yay!
    ok 2 - no (unexpected) warnings (via done_testing)
    1..2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you've ever tried to use L<Test::NoWarnings> to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of C<done_testing> to
not have to declare a
L<test count|Test::More/I love it-when-a-plan-comes-together>,
you'll have discovered that these two features do not play well together,
as the test count will be calculated I<before> the warnings test is run,
resulting in a TAP error. (See C<examples/test_nowarnings.pl> in this
distribution for a demonstration.)

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
L<Test::NoWarnings>: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test I<before>
C<done_testing> calculates the test count, rather than after.  It does this by
hooking into C<done_testing> as well as via an C<END> block.  You can declare
a plan, or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur.  You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with C<use Test::Warnings;> whether or not your tests have a plan.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are available for import (not included by default; you
can also get all of them by importing the tag C<:all>):

=over

=item * C<< allow_warnings([bool]) >> - EXPERIMENTAL - MAY BE REMOVED

When passed a true value, or no value at all, subsequent warnings will not
result in a test failure; when passed a false value, subsequent warnings will
result in a test failure.  Initial value is C<false>.

=item * C<allowing_warnings> - EXPERIMENTAL - MAY BE REMOVED

Returns whether we are currently allowing warnings (set by C<allow_warnings>
as described above).

=item * C<< had_no_warnings(<optional test name>) >>

Tests whether there have been any warnings so far, not preceded by an
C<allowing_warnings> call.  It is run
automatically at the end of all tests, but can also be called manually at any
time, as often as desired.

=back

=head1 OTHER OPTIONS

=over

=item * C<:all> - Imports all functions listed above

=item * C<:no_end_test> - Disables the addition of a C<had_no_warnings> test via END (but if you don't want to do this, you probably shouldn't be loading this module at all!)

=back

=head1 TO DO (i.e. FUTURE FEATURES, MAYBE)

=over

=item * C<< allow_warnings(qr/.../) >> - allow some warnings and not others

=item * C<< warning_is, warning_like etc... >> - inclusion of some
L<Test::Warn>-like functionality for testing the content of warnings, but
closer to a L<Test::Fatal>-like syntax

=item * more sophisticated handling in subtests - if we save some state on the
L<Test::Builder> object itself, we can allow warnings in a subtest and then
the state will revert when the subtest ends, as well as check for warnings at
the end of every subtest via C<done_testing>.
